# Windows rootkit project
This repository contains the results of a student project about Windows rootkit.

This project was realized during the 4th year of the ENSIBS Cyberdefense degree.

The folders documentation contains files about the project goal and some high level explanations.

There are no documentations to build easily the code. So, GOOD LUCK !!!
